Why Learn DSA in C?
C language is a perfect choice for learning data structures and algorithms due to the following reasons:

Deep Understanding: C language requires the programmer to implement every feature manually, which helps in understanding how data structures work at a fundamental level.
Versatility: Knowledge of DSA in C can be transferred to other languages, as many modern languages are built on C-like syntax.
Interview Preparation: Due to its speed and efficiency, many technical interviews and competitive programming problems are best solved using C.
Strong Foundation for Other Languages: Many modern programming languages like C++, Java, and Python are based on C-like syntax. Mastering DSA in C builds a strong foundation that can be easily transferred to other languages, making it easier to adapt to different programming environments.
